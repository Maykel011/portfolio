      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I’m <strong>John Michael Montes</strong>, a passionate web developer and fresh graduate of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) from Jose Rizal University. 
      My journey in IT has been driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to using technology as a tool to solve problems and make learning more engaging.</p>
        <br>
      <p>During my academic years, I served as the <strong>leader of our capstone project </strong>Gamified Mathematics Learning through Web Development for Grade 1 Students. This project was designed to enhance the knowledge of early learners through interactive, game-based lessons that make education fun and accessible. As project leader, I guided my team in planning, development, and implementation, ensuring that every component—from design to functionality—aligned with our vision of building a meaningful educational tool. This experience strengthened not only 
      my technical expertise in PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also my leadership, collaboration, and project management skills.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Beyond the classroom, I constantly explore how <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> can be integrated into web development to accelerate processes and unlock innovative solutions. While I use AI as a supportive tool, 
      I firmly believe it does not replace human skill—it enhances creativity and efficiency, allowing me to focus on delivering unique, high-quality results.</p>
        <br>
      <p>I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and always eager to learn new technologies. Whether it’s designing intuitive user interfaces, optimizing back-end functionality, or experimenting with 
        modern web trends, I approach every project with dedication and a problem-solving mindset.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute my skills to forward-thinking teams and organizations where I can continue to grow as a developer, 
        build impactful systems, and create digital solutions that deliver real-world value.</p>
